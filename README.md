# MNIST-CNN-Verilog

*FPGA-Based CNN for MNIST Digit Recognition*

A fully synthesizable implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Verilog for inference, designed for FPGA deployment. This project achieves 95% accuracy on the MNIST handwritten digit recognition dataset.

# Overview

This project implements CNN inference in hardware, demonstrating how modern machine learning algorithms can be efficiently deployed on FPGA platforms. The design uses pre-trained weights and biases loaded through .mif files, focusing purely on the inference stage of the neural network.
